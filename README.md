# Glass By Silly Impala
Glass is a universal utility application designed to be free and open source.

Glass will allow users to customise and place "Glass Panels" on their screens which contain varying degrees of information.
Such panels can include:
  - System Performance (CPU, RAM and GPU usage and temperatures)
  - Date & Time
  - Timers
  - Quick Launch Icons
  - Notifications
  - Custom information

These panels are intended to be designed in such a way where they look nice, while remaining performant and unobtrusive in the user's system.
They will allow the user to quickly see chosen and customised information at a glance, hopefully improving productivity by keeping certain information
on the screen at all times.

## Practical Usage
While the main intention of the **Glass panels** are to remain on the screen on top of other applications, this will be disabled by default.
Users will be able to click on a pin icon which will then toggle the 'on top' function of the panels.

For panels which contain dynamic updating information such as system performance, the panel will call an update to these values every two
seconds by default, however the value may be changed by the user in the application settings.

## Custom Panels
Custom panels will have the ability to contain varying degrees of user specified information. Custom panels will have the ability to display
plugin information that may be developed by the Open Source community.

# Glass Social
**Glass Social** is a sister application which will be developed alongside **Glass**. Glass Social is an open source instant messaging platform with
the intention of inviting the Open Source community to help build an application that is suitable for many different ranges of use-cases, filling 
a gap where other instant messaging platforms fall short. While the initial application will find itself being a very rudimentary system, only
supporting text and emojis, with support from the greater Open Source community, it can become anything it needs to be.

Keep an eye on my GitHub account for more information on Glass Social when I create the repo for it.

# Open Source Community Driven
The main benefits of **Glass** comes from its Open Source nature, and the community that may help to develop it into something much more versatile.
I will be bringing the base application to the table, and leaving all source code open and available. This application relies heavily on the Open Source
community to flourish as something that may be used as an alternative to other more restrictive platforms.
